    <h1>why python?</h1>
    <!-- creating a paragraph-->
    <p>
        Every year I consider whether to continue using Python or whether to move
        on to a different language—perhaps one that’s newer to the programming
        world. But I continue to focus on Python for many reasons. Python is an
        incredibly efficient language: your programs will do more in fewer lines of
        code than many other languages would require. Python’s syntax will also
        help you write “clean” code. Your code will be easy to read, easy to debug,
        and easy to extend and build upon compared to other languages.<br>
        People use Python for many purposes: to make games, build web appli-
        cations, solve business problems, and develop internal tools at all kinds of
        interesting companies. Python is also used heavily in scientific fields for
        academic research and applied work.<BR>
        One of the most important reasons I continue to use Python is because
        of the Python community, which includes an incredibly diverse and welcom-
        ing group of people. Community is essential to programmers because pro-
        gramming isn’t a solitary pursuit. Most of us, even the most experienced
        programmers, need to ask advice from others who have already solved
        similar problems. Having a well-connected and supportive community is
        critical in helping you solve problems, and the Python community is fully
        supportive of people like you who are learning Python as your first pro-
        gramming language. <br>python  is a great language to learn, so let’s get started</p>
